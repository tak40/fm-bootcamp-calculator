# Frontend Master Bootcamp Calculator Project

## Introduction

This project is part of the Frontend Masters Bootcamp. It focuses on creating a calculator using HTML and CSS. This is me diving back into the basics to ensure I haven't missed anything and to hone my skills. JavaScript functionality will be added in a separate lesson.

## Project Structure

- **begin/**: Contains the initial setup of the project.
  - **css/**: Stylesheets with a modern design.
  - **calculator.html**: Initial HTML file.
- **end/**: Contains the final version of the project provided by the instructor.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS**: Demonstrates the use of various HTML elements and CSS properties.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for a modern, sleek calculator design.

## Personal Learnings

While working on this project, I revisited and found several concepts interesting and important:

- **Starting from Scratch**: It was great to start from a blank state, requiring me to think about my approach.
- **Different Coding Approach**: Ended up with a coding approach very different from the instructor's, which is totally fine.
- **CSS Grid**: The biggest lesson was learning how to use CSS Grid. Aligning elements to fit the calculator layout was challenging but rewarding. The `grid-column` property and setting up the grid template correctly were key.
- **Hover and Active States**: Implemented hover and active states for better user experience (UX).
